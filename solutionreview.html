    <h2>November 26th, 2018 <br> by: Shannon Frierson <br></h2>
    <main> As an avid fan of Glossier, I was super super excited when the viral company recently came out with their own version
        of a chemical exfoliant. 

    <img src="../images/solutionimage1.jpg" alt= "solutionimage1" class="bodyimages">

    <p> Containing AHAs, BHAs, and PHAs, Glossier's Solution is a great is a great introductory acid for those who are just getting into 
        the complicated world of chemical exfoliants. At .05% salicylic acid (BHA) and 10% glycolic acid (AHA), lactic acid (AHA), 
        and gluconolacctone (PHA) it is gentle enough to be used on a daily basis but is still effective at sloughing away dead skin cells 
        revealing brighter and clearer skin. </p>

    <img src="../images/solutionimage2.jpg" alt= "solutionimage2" class="bodyimages">

    <p> After using Solution for a few months on and off, I have seen visible improvement in my skin with consistent use. My acne has significantly 
        cleared up as well as faded any lingering acne scars. I use solution on a daily basis, usually in the morning as I tend to use stronger acids 
        or retinols as part of my evening routine. It serves as a nice pre-makeup step, exfoliating away any dry patches that makeup would cling to. 
        When using acids during the day it is especially important to follow up with a good SPF as your skin becomes even more susceptible to the sun’s harmful rays. </p>

    <img src="../images/solutionimage3.jpg" alt= "solutionimage3" class="bodyimages">

    <p>At $24, Solution is relatively affordable compared to other chemical exfoliants on the market. It is a great one step way to get all of the benefits 
        from using both AHAs and BHAs as well as the lesser known PHAs. I would recommend Solution to most skin types, possibly excluding mature skin or those with 
        very sensitive skin. Is it the best chemical exfoliant available, no, but I do think it is a perfect beginner acid for those who are just getting into skincare.
    <br> Solution can be purchased though Glossier’s website <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" class="links">here.</a> </p>
