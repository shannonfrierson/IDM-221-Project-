            Glossier markets it’s Balm Dotcom as a trendy skin salve for millennials. With beautifully designed minimalist packaging, 
            I will admit I was willing to shell out the $12 for the Glossier cult favorite. Is it glorified vaseline, yes. Would I buy 
            it again and do I want all of the flavors, yes and yes.

            With a wide array of flavors and even some tinted options, the one I ultimately purchased was Birthday, the result of a collaboration 
            with NYC’s Milk Bar which just happens to be one of my favorite bakeries in the city. Birthday is basically a clear balm with an almost 
            undetectable light shimmer running through it. As someone who is very anti-glitter, Glossier got the amount of shimmer just right, 
            providing a slight but beautiful reflection in direct light. But fundamentally, nothing super amazing or unique to write home about. 
            The flavor though. Oh my god the flavor though. I could literally eat the whole tube of this that is how good it tastes. It’s reminiscent 
            of the Lip Smackers era but some how grown up and sophisticated. Like your vanilla Lip Smackers older cousin who has her life together.
